    <h1>In-N-Out vs. Five Guys vs. Shake Shack: Burger Battle</h1>
</header>

<article>
    <p>If you’ve ever argued about who makes the best burger, you already know this debate can get heated. Some people swear by In-N-Out, others say Five Guys is unbeatable, and then there’s the <a href="https://innoutmenus.w3spaces.com/index.html">Shake Shack crowd</a>, claiming it’s on another level. I’ve tried all three—multiple times (for research, of course). And let me tell you, each has its own charm. But when it comes to the ultimate burger battle, who really wins? Let’s break it down.</p>

    <div class="intro">
        <p><strong>Quick Comparison:</strong> In-N-Out is known for affordability and classic flavors, Five Guys for indulgent and customizable burgers, and Shake Shack for premium, gourmet offerings.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Burger Quality: Freshness, Flavor & Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>In-N-Out: Simple but Iconic</h3>
    <p>In-N-Out keeps it old-school. Their burgers are made with fresh, never frozen beef, hand-leafed lettuce, and a signature spread that gives it that extra kick. But the real secret? <a href="https://innoutmenus0.web.app/">Mustard-grilled patties</a> (if you order Animal Style).</p>
    <p>The flavors are balanced—not too greasy, not too fancy, just classic, clean, and delicious. But compared to the others, the patty is thinner, which some people feel makes it less satisfying.</p>

    <h3>Five Guys: Juicy & Customizable</h3>
    <p>If you like your burger thick and loaded, Five Guys is your spot. Their patties are hand-formed, and they cook everything fresh—no freezers in sight.</p>
    <p>Customization is the name of the game here. You can pile on grilled mushrooms, jalapeños, extra cheese, or whatever your heart desires. The trade-off? These burgers drip with grease. Some call it flavor, others think it’s too much.</p>

    <h3>Shake Shack: The Gourmet Touch</h3>
    <p>Shake Shack goes for a premium feel. Their burgers use 100% Angus beef, and the potato bun adds a soft, buttery texture. The ShackSauce gives it a unique tang that sets it apart.</p>
    <p>Out of the three, this one tastes the most upscale—but it’s also the smallest. Some people find it overpriced for the size.</p>

    <p class="winner">Winner: Tie</p>
    <p>It all depends on what you like. In-N-Out is classic, Five Guys is indulgent, and Shake Shack is gourmet.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Fries: Crispy or Forgettable?</h2>
    <h3>In-N-Out: Hit or Miss</h3>
    <p>In-N-Out fries are controversial. They’re fresh-cut and fried in 100% sunflower oil, but they can be dry. The trick? Order them well-done or Animal Style for extra crunch and flavor.</p>

    <h3>Five Guys: Overload of Flavor</h3>
    <p>Five Guys fries are hand-cut, fried in peanut oil, and served in insane portions. They’re thick, <a href="https://innoutmenus.innoutmenu9.workers.dev/">crispy</a>, and come in Cajun seasoning if you want extra spice. If you love salty, crispy, and greasy fries, Five Guys wins this round.</p>

    <h3>Shake Shack: Crinkle-Cut Classic</h3>
    <p>Shake Shack plays it safe with crinkle-cut fries. They’re crispy, hold up well in cheese sauce, and don’t get soggy fast. Not as bold as Five Guys, but way better than In-N-Out’s plain version.</p>

    <p class="winner">Winner: Five Guys</p>
    <p>More flavor, better texture, and you get a whole bag full.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Price: Which One Gives You the Best Bang for Your Buck?</h2>
    <h3>In-N-Out: The Budget King</h3>
    <p>In-N-Out is by far the most affordable. A Double-Double costs around $5, and you can get a full meal for under $10. That’s unheard of in today’s fast-food world.</p>

    <h3>Five Guys: Pricey but Huge Portions</h3>
    <p>Five Guys is the most expensive—but you also get way more food. A basic burger is around $9, but it’s bigger and heavier than the others. The fries alone are enough for two people.</p>

    <h3>Shake Shack: Premium Pricing for Smaller Portions</h3>
    <p>Shake Shack’s burgers cost $7-$9, and their fries and shakes are also on the pricey side. You’re paying for higher quality, but the portion sizes don’t match the price tag.</p>

    <p class="winner">Winner: In-N-Out</p>
    <p>It’s the best value for what you get.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Milkshakes: Who Does It Best?</h2>
    <h3>In-N-Out: Basic but Tasty</h3>
    <p>In-N-Out shakes are thick, creamy, and simple. They don’t do anything wild—just chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry—but they’re classic and satisfying.</p>

    <h3>Five Guys: Rich & Customizable</h3>
    <p>Five Guys lets you mix flavors like peanut butter, coffee, and banana. Their shakes are extra creamy since they use real ice cream, making them the most indulgent of the three.</p>

    <h3>Shake Shack: Smooth & Flavorful</h3>
    <p>Shake Shack shakes have a velvety texture, thanks to their frozen custard base. They taste more premium but are a bit smaller than Five Guys.</p>
